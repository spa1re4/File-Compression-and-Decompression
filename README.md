# File-Compression-and-Decompression
Assignment Description: In this assignment, you will explore file compression and decompression techniques in C++. You will implement a simple compression algorithm to compress the content of a text file and create a corresponding program to decompress the compressed file to retrieve the original content. This assignment will help you understand the basics of data compression and gain hands-on experience with file manipulation in C++.

Compression Program:

Input text from a "input.txt" file.
Compresses the content of a text file using a simple compression algorithm. 
You can choose any basic compression technique such as Run-Length Encoding, Huffman Coding, or simple dictionary-based compression.
Store the compressed data in a new file called "compressed.txt".
Decompression Program:

Develop a separate C++ program for decompressing the compressed file generated by the compression program.
Write the decompressed data to a new text file called "decompressed.txt".
Verify that the decompressed file matches the original content of the input text file.
Testing:
Test your compression and decompression programs with various text files of different sizes and contents.
Ensure that the decompressed files accurately represent the original content of the input files.
Measure and compare the compression ratios achieved by your compression program for different input files.
GitHub Repository:

   - Create a GitHub repository for your project and commit your code to it. 

Documentation (README.md):
Document your project to explain the compression and decompression algorithms, major functions, and code blocks.
Provide a brief explanation of the chosen compression technique and its implementation details.
Include instructions on how to compile and run your compression and decompression programs.
Submission

In your submission, provide GitHub repository link to your project folder.
Evaluation Criteria:

Input and Output from File (20 points)
Implements a compression algorithm effectively (20 points)
Successfully decompresses data compressed by the program (20 points)
README file provides clear documentation (20 points)
Provides a variety of test files with different sizes and contents (20 points)
Late Submission Penalty:

For each day of late submission, a penalty of 20 points will be deducted from the total score.
